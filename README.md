# Signal provisioning API

This extends singalapp/libsignal-client (https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal-client), which doesn't provide provisioning API for registering new devices.

Current version is compatible with libsignal-client tag `v0.11.0` and there is no versioning schema for this library (yet).

Example client implemantation is under way and will be linked here when ready.

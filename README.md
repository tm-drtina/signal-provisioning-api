# Signal provisioning API

This extends singalapp/libsignal (https://github.com/signalapp/libsignal), which doesn't provide provisioning API for registering new devices.

Current version is compatible with libsignal tag `v0.18.1` and there is no versioning schema for this library (yet).

Example client implemantation is still under way, but for reference: https://github.com/tm-drtina/signal-dbus-client
